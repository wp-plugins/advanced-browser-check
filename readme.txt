Tell IE users to change browser? Or is your site for chrome only? Now you choose what browsers should trigger a warning popup or not on your site.

== Description ==

This plugin give you the option to give a visitor of your site a warning popup if they use a browser that you don't support. For example, Internet Explorer 6.

It supports the 5 largest and most populare browser on the market.

* Firefox
* Chrome
* Safari
* Opera
* Internet Explorer

You can customize the warning message, choose what browsers download pages you want to display a link to, select what browsers and browser versions that should trigger the popup and if the use can or can't hide the popup.

If you allow users to hide the popup, a cookie is set that expires after 24h. After 24h, the user will see the popup again with the option to hide it for another 24h.

This plugin is tested and works with the WP Super Cache plugin. It is also tested and working on Wordpress Networks.

*There is versions added of browsers that it not yet released as stable versions. This is just to minimize the need of an plugin update in the future when new browsers are released and to let users that use the beta and alpha version to test this plugin with there browsers. I will do my best to keep this plugin updated with the latest versions of avaliable browsers.*

== Installation ==

1. Upload the zipped file to yoursite/wp-content/plugins
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
