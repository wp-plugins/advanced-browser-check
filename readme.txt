Tell IE users to change browser? Or your site is only for chrome? Now you choose what browsers should trigger a warning popup or not on your site.

== Description ==

This plugin give you the option to give a visitor of your site a warning popup if they use a browser that you don't support on your site. For example, Internet Explorer 6.

It supports the 5 largest and most populare browser on the market.

* Firefox
* Chrome
* Safari
* Opera
* Internet Explorer

You can customize the warning message, choose what browsers DL pages you want to show a link to, select what browsers and browser versions that should trigger the popup and if the use can or can't hide the popup.

If the option to allow users to hide the popup, a cookie that expires after 24h will be created. After 24h, the user will see the popup again with the option to hide it once more.

This plugin need javascript activated in the visitors browser to work. Why? To get the plugin to work with caching plugins for Wordpress it needs to do a AJAX request to the plugin file.

*There are added versions of browsers that not yet is released as stable versions. This is just to minimize the need of an plugin update in the future when new browsers are released. I will do my best to keep this plugin updated with the latest versions of avaliable browsers.*

1. Upload the zipped file to yoursite/wp-content/plugins
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
